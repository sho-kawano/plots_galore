# plots_galore
Some of the nicest plots I created when doing aerosol chemistry research at UC Davis. 
This is PM1.0 data measured by an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory. 

These notebooks are a demonstration of my plotting skills using both R and Python.
